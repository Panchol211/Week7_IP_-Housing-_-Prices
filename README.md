What is the goal of analysis ?

The goal of this analysis is to develop a prediction model that can be used to accurately predict the sale price of houses given various predictor variables. The model will be developed after studying several factors that affect housing prices in the real estate industry.



Defining the Metric for Success


This analysis will be considered a success when we are able to apply various regressions to the dataset in order to identify the best prediction model that has the highest accuracy level. The baseline model should be identified and compared to other regression models. The prediction model should not have overfitting or underfitting




Understanding the Context

A company such as Hass Consulting, needs to be able to sell real estate properties at a price that is both profitable to the company as well as fair price for the buyers for the business to go on.

The following factors affect the price of any real estate property.These include the square footage, number of rooms, location, year of construction and the nature of views and amenities available in the locale. This analysis seeks to study some of the mentioned variables and train a regression model that can the be used to predict the price of a house. The models tested in this analysis include multiple linear regression, quantile regression, ridge regression, lasso regression and elastic net regression




Experimental Design process
